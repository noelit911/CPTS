`Network File System` (`NFS`) is a network file system developed by Sun Microsystems and has the same purpose as SMB.

The most common authentication is via UNIX `UID`/`GID` and `group memberships`, which is why this syntax is most likely to be applied to the NFS protocol. One problem is that the client and server do not necessarily have to have the same mappings of UID/GID to users and groups, and the server does not need to do anything further. No further checks can be made on the part of the server. This is why NFS should only be used with this authentication method in trusted networks.

## Dangerous Settings

However, even with NFS, some settings can be dangerous for the company and its infrastructure. Here are some of them listed:

|**Option**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`rw`|Read and write permissions.|
|`insecure`|Ports above 1024 will be used.|
|`nohide`|If another file system was mounted below an exported directory, this directory is exported by its own exports entry.|
|`no_root_squash`|All files created by root are kept with the UID/GID 0.|
We can take a look at the `insecure` option. This is dangerous because users can use ports above 1024. The first 1024 ports can only be used by root. This prevents the fact that no users can use sockets above port 1024 for the NFS service and interact with it.
