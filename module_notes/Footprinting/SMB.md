An SMB server can provide arbitrary parts of its local file system as shares. Therefore the hierarchy visible to a client is partially independent of the structure on the server. Access rights are defined by `Access Control Lists` (`ACL`). They can be controlled in a fine-grained manner based on attributes such as `execute`, `read`, and `full access` for individual users or user groups. The ACLs are defined based on the shares and therefore do not correspond to the rights assigned locally on the server.

## Dangerous Settings

Some of the above settings already bring some sensitive options. However, suppose we question the settings listed below and ask ourselves what the employees could gain from them, as well as attackers. 

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`browseable = yes`|Allow listing available shares in the current share?|
|`read only = no`|Forbid the creation and modification of files?|
|`writable = yes`|Allow users to create and modify files?|
|`guest ok = yes`|Allow connecting to the service without using a password?|
|`enable privileges = yes`|Honor privileges assigned to specific SID?|
|`create mask = 0777`|What permissions must be assigned to the newly created files?|
|`directory mask = 0777`|What permissions must be assigned to the newly created directories?|
|`logon script = script.sh`|What script needs to be executed on the user's login?|
|`magic script = script.sh`|Which script should be executed when the script gets closed?|
|`magic output = script.out`|Where the output of the magic script needs to be stored?|

Smbclient also allows us to execute local system commands using an exclamation mark at the beginning (`!<cmd>`) without interrupting the connection.

#### Samba Status

From the administrative point of view, we can check these connections using `smbstatus`. Apart from the Samba version, we can also see who, from which host, and which share the client is connected. This is especially important once we have entered a subnet (perhaps even an isolated one) that the others can still access.

```shell-session
root@samba:~# smbstatus

Samba version 4.11.6-Ubuntu

#### Brute Forcing User RIDs

```shell-session
eikisgv@htb[/htb]$ for i in $(seq 500 1100);do rpcclient -N -U "" 10.129.14.128 -c "queryuser 0x$(printf '%x\n' $i)" | grep "User Name\|user_rid\|group_rid" && echo "";done
```
