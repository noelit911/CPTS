`Nmap` looks at the banners of the scanned ports and prints them out. If it cannot identify versions through the banners, `Nmap` attempts to identify them through a signature-based matching system, but this significantly increases the scan's duration. One disadvantage to `Nmap`'s presented results is that the automatic scan can miss some information because sometimes `Nmap` does not know how to handle it. Let us look at an example of this.

```shell-session
eikisgv@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -sV -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-16 20:10 CEST

```

f we look at the results from `Nmap`, we can see the port's status, service name, and hostname. Nevertheless, let us look at this line here:

- `NSOCK INFO [0.4200s] nsock_trace_handler_callback(): Callback: READ SUCCESS for EID 18 [10.129.2.28:25] (35 bytes): 220 inlane ESMTP Postfix (Ubuntu)..`

Then we see that the SMTP server on our target gave us more information than `Nmap` showed us. Because here, we see that it is the Linux distribution `Ubuntu`. It happens because, after a successful three-way handshake, the server often sends a banner for identification. This serves to let the client know which service it is working with. At the network level, this happens with a `PSH` flag in the TCP header. However, it can happen that some services do not immediately provide such information. It is also possible to remove or manipulate the banners from the respective services. If we `manually` connect to the SMTP server using `nc`, grab the banner, and intercept the network traffic using `tcpdump`, we can see what `Nmap` did not show us.
