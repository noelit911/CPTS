`Nmap` looks at the banners of the scanned ports and prints them out. If it cannot identify versions through the banners, `Nmap` attempts to identify them through a signature-based matching system, but this significantly increases the scan's duration. One disadvantage to `Nmap`'s presented results is that the automatic scan can miss some information because sometimes `Nmap` does not know how to handle it. Let us look at an example of this.

```shell-session
eikisgv@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -sV -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace
